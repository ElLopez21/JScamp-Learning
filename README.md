## üëã About Me & This Journey

Hey! I'm Erik Lopez, and I'm a software developer working through Midudev's JScamp bootcamp as part of my commitment to continuous learning and skill honing. This repository serves as my **public learning log**, documenting my progress through the curriculum and the insights I gain along the way. 

**Objectives:**
- **Strengthen Fundamentals** - Revisit core concepts with intentionality
- **Modern Stack Proficiency** - Deepen expertise in current technologies and best practices
- **Consistent Practice** - Build the habit of daily development work
- **Knowledge Sharing** - "You give, give, give. Why? Because you love to. It‚Äôs not a strategy, it‚Äôs a way of life.‚Äù - Bob Burg
